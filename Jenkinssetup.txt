Jenkins installation in CentOs/Redhat.
To use this repository, run the following command: 

Step No1: add repository


  sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
  sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
  
If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the rpm --import will fail because you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on. 
Step No2:- Install epel and openjdk softwares

  yum install epel-release # repository that provides 'daemonize'
  yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
  yum install jenkins -y
  
Step No3:- Start the Jenkin service and enable 

# systemctl start jenkins
# systemctl enable jenkins


Step No:4: Add port in FirewallD

# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
# firewall-cmd – -reload

Step No:5 Open browser

Type http:[systemip]:8080
http:10.0.0.22:8080
Unlock Jenkins
When you access Jenkins for the first time (after installation) it will ask you the password. And to know the password run the below command, and you will see a 32-character alphanumeric password.

$ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Xysk23kklfxkfjd

Copy the password and paste it into the Jenkins Administrator section.

On the Next page, Jenkins will ask you to choose/install the suggested plugins or the select most suitable/specific plugins.
For this blog, I choose suggested plugins to continue the plugin’s installation process.
Customize Jenkins

Next, it will ask you to setup the first admin user, fill in the details and click on ‘save and continue’.

In the next steps, you will get the Jenkins URL with the port. Click on ‘save and finish‘.
